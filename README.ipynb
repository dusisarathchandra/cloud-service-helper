    "A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to predict the category of cloud assets. This project integrates AI-based techniques to assist in finding relevant cloud asset service categories based on user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicts cloud asset service categories.\n",
    "- Utilizes RAG architecture with _LanceDB_ (for Vector Search) and _ElasticSearch_.\n",
    "- Added support to use Open Source models locally using *_Ollama_*.\n",
    "- Monitoring support to view dashboards.\n",

    "### What is Cloud Asset Service Categorization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Asset Service Categorization is the process of systematically classifying cloud resources and services into predefined categories. These categories can include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Compute resources (e.g., virtual machines, containers)\n",
    " - Storage services (e.g., object storage, block storage)\n",
    " - Networking components (e.g., load balancers, VPNs)\n",
    " - Database services\n",
    " - Security and identity management tools\n",
    " - Analytics and big data services\n",
    " - Developer tools and services\n",
    " - AI and machine learning platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "This categorization plays a crucial role in managing, optimizing, and securing cloud environments, particularly as businesses continue to migrate more of their operations to the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Created a fictional businees usecase to explain the need of Cloud Asset Service Categorization.\n",
    "Refer this [document](./setup-docs/cloud-asset-service-categorization.md) to check the business proposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Docker\n",
    "- Docker Compose\n",
    "- Python 3.9+\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up this project locally, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the repository:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   git clone https://github.com/dusisarathchandra/llm-RAG-cloud-asset-service-categorization.git\n",
    "   cd llm-RAG-cloud-service-helper\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   python -m venv env\n",
    "   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install the required dependencies:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set Up Docker Compose\n",
    "- Follow this [link](./setup-docs/docker-compose-installation-guide.md) to install `docker-compose`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Start the docker-compose \n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   docker-compose up --build\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Confirm that the containers are running\n",
